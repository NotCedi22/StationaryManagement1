Restore StationeryDB.bak into SQL Server (SSMS)

1) Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance.
2) Right-click "Databases" > "Restore Database...".
3) Source: choose "Device", click "...", then "Add", browse to StationeryDB.bak (this folder), and select it.
4) Destination: set database name (e.g., StationeryManagement1).
5) Files: ensure data/log paths are valid for your server.
6) Options:
   - Check "Overwrite the existing database (WITH REPLACE)" only if you intend to replace an existing DB.
   - Uncheck "Take tail-log backup" unless you need it.
7) Click "OK" to restore and wait for the success message.

Post-restore checks
1) Expand the database > Tables to confirm objects are present.
2) Run a quick query (e.g., SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Roles) to verify data.
3) Update your appsettings connection string to point to this server/database; ensure the login has needed rights (db_owner or appropriate).

If restoring to a different server/instance
- Update connection string (Server=YOURSERVER;Database=StationeryManagement1;User Id=...;Password=...;TrustServerCertificate=True;).
- For Windows Auth, use Integrated Security=True and omit user/password.

If you have a .bacpac instead
- In SSMS: Right-click "Databases" > "Import Data-tier Application..." and follow the wizard.
